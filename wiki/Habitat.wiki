= Recommendations =

The habitat is the ecological or environmental area in which the specimen was collected, and may  be explicitly provided on the label.

If habitat is explicitly provided on the label, report this value.  When recording habitat in the field, report according to a published standard, and cite the source of the standard in parentheses.  If a habitat is not provided on the label and is derived post-facto from the locality description, it is recommended to report habitat according to a published standard and cite the source of the standard in parentheses followed by a semicolon and the word “derived”.
