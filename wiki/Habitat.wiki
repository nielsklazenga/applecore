The habitat is the ecological or environmental area in which the specimen was collected, and may  be explicitly provided on the label.

If habitat is explicitly provided on the label, report this value.  When recording habitat in the field, it is recommended to report according to a published source, citing the source in parentheses.  If a habitat is not provided on the label and is derived post-facto from the locality description, it is recommended to report habitat according to a published source and cite the source in parentheses followed by a semicolon and the word “derived”.
