= Recommendations =

== Core only ==

3 values in typeStatus, separated by "|" or "; "

 # controlled vocabulary
 # typified scientific name -> *any other field we can use* [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#originalNameUsage originalNameUsage]?
 # publication -> *any other field we can use?* [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#namePublishedIn namePublishedIn]?

== Extension ==

Linked to a determination {JM: did we make this extension up or is it from a source? We want to keep to the core and it may be worth not including this?}

 * typeStatus = controlled vocabulary
 * typified scientific name = scientific name = basionym
 * publication = namePublishedIn

== Controlled vocabulary ==

*Create controlled vocabulary for types*

= Examples =

Give example for core only and extension

 # known species name
 # new species name = basionym => specimen becomes a holotype for that name
 # new name combination (new genus) = new combination => specimen becomes a type for that name

 # known species name
 # holotype
 # syntype
