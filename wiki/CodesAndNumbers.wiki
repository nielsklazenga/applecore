= Recommendations =

== Collection codes ==

If you have an Index Herbariorum coden, put it in collectionCode.
datasetName is intended for a researcher oriented view of the data.
For all those terms: there can be only one (1) value (no lists).

== Specimen number ==
Provide the primary identifier used by the herbarium for a specimen in *catalogNumber*. This identifier might be called the specimen number, accession number, catalog number or barcode. It consists of a string of characters, which uniquely identifies a specimen within the herbarium.
If 

If useful add a prefix for a specimen number series.
Numbers to dump in otherCatalogNumbers: any number on the specimen that is not used as the primary catalogNumber or recordNumber.

== Collector number ==
No structure, can be anything.
In the case of multiple collector numbers, separate with “;”.
List the primary number first.
