== How to express collecting teams (i.e., more than one collector)==

 * The primary collector, especially one who applies a personal identifier (recordNumber), should be listed first.
 * Formatting should follow the recommendations for a single collector.
 * Separate with "|" or ";" (Note: this differs from the Harvard Index Team notation)
 * Avoid "&" for separating the last author. (Note: this differs from the Harvard Index Team notation)
 * Mention that you can concatenate collector fields.
 * Use verbatim

Last name1, First names1, title1; Last name2, First names2, title2

|| Macklin, James A.; Moore, Gerry; Lendemer, James Colin ||

 * Where a team/expedition name has been designated and no names are available, use the team/expedition name.

|| Hay, Stuart G.; !FloraQuebeca ||

|| Edinburgh Expedition to Sikkim & Darjeeling|| 
(Note that in this example the "&" remains as it is part of the expedition name.)
