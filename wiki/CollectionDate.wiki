The collection date is the date, date range or dates on which a specimen was collected, and is typically written on the specimen label.

== Verbatim date ==

The verbatim date is the collection date as written on the specimen label (see the definition for [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/Glossary#Verbatim verbatim]) and is recorded in a single free-text field.

It is recommended to always record a verbatim date as it is the most objective way to record the collection date and in some cases even the only way to do so. Alternatively, a verbatim date can be recorded when the [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/CollectionDate#Formatted_date Formatted date] cannot unambiguously represent the collection date (see [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/CollectionDate#Examples examples]).

Provide the verbatim date in *_[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/verbatimEventDate verbatimEventDate]_*. Remarks or notes regarding the collection date are accepted in this term as long as the verbatim date is included as well: "3/5/2009 (probably March)" or if the date is illegible: "illisible". If a database field contains verbatim and non-verbatim dates or if it is unknown whether the field corresponds to the verbatim date, it should _not_ be considered a _verbatimEventDate_.

== Formatted date ==

As the verbatim date doesn't readily allows calculation and sorting, most collections (also) record the collection date in a structured format. This can be done in numerous ways:

 * Date = 1980 Jul 8-15
 * Date = 7/8-15/1980
 * Date = 8-15/7/1980
 * Date = 8-15.07.80
 * Date = 8-15 VII 1980
 * Date = 1980-07-08/15 (recommended)
 * Date = 1980-07-08/1980-07-15 (recommended)
 * Start date = 1980 Jul 8 | End date = 1980 Jul 15
 * Day = 8-15 | Month = 7 | Year = 1980
 * Start day = 8 | Start month = 7 | Start year = 1980 | End day = 15 | End month = 7 | End year = 1980

It is recommended to store any formatted date using the *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601:2004(E)]* standard. In ISO 8601 date and time values are organized from the most to the least significant and with a fixed number of digits per value: YYYY-MM-DD. Date ranges are expressed with a forward slash: YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD/MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD/DD. Partial dates can only be expressed by dropping the least significant values first: YYYY-MM or YYYY, but never MM-DD.  For more information and examples, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 and http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/wiki/Event.

If it is necessary to record the collection date in multiple fields (start/end date or day/month/year), try to store the date in a format close to ISO 8601, so it can easily be transformed by concatenation.

Provide the formatted collection date in *_[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventDate eventDate]_*. It is *highly recommended to use the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO 8601:2004(E)] standard*, as it allows the date information to be shared unambiguously. Other date formats should only be used if the collection is unable to record or transform the dates to ISO 8601.

Although date ranges can be expressed in _eventDate_, multiple dates cannot. See example 6 in [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/CollectionDate#Examples examples].

== Other date terms ==

In addition to _eventDate_, Darwin Core offers several other date terms which allow (part of) the collection date to be expressed in a more readily useable format (see [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/CollectionDate#Examples examples]). Provide values for this terms if feasible.

Some guidelines:
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventTime eventTime]: Useful if the time is recorded, but not the date (otherwise _[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/eventDate eventDate]_ can be used as well). Rare for herbarium specimens.
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/startDayOfYear startDayOfYear]: If the (leap)year is unknown, do not use for dates after February 28.
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/endDayOfYear endDayOfYear]: For single dates, provide the same value as in _startDayOfYear_.
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/year year]: 4 digits. Do not use for ranges spanning two different years.
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/month month]: Do not use leading zeros. Do not use for ranges spanning two different months.
 * [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/day day]: Do not use leading zeros. Do not use for ranges.

 * Example 2: If additional information is available regarding the month (January or March), the terms can be populated as in example 1.
 * Example 4: The _eventDate_ can only express partial dates from the least to the most significant. In this case the most significant (year) is missing.
 * Example 5: The _eventDate_ in example 5 may also be written as 1947-07-24/25.
 * Example 6: Some herbarium specimens have multiple dates (e.g. one for the flower and one for the plant). Multiple dates cannot be expressed in _eventDate_.
