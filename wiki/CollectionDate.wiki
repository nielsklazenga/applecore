The collection date is the date, date range or dates on which a specimen was collected, and is typically written on the specimen label. It can be recorded in collection databases in numerous ways.

== Verbatim date ==

The verbatim date is the collection date as written on the specimen label (see the definition for [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/Glossary#Verbatim verbatim]) and is recorded in a single free-text field. It is useful as it is the most objective way to record the date and in some cases even the only way to do so.

Provide the verbatim date in *_verbatimEventDate_*. Remarks or notes regarding the collection date are accepted in this term as long as the verbatim date is included as well: "3/5/2009 (probably March)" or if the date is illegible: "illisible". If a database field contains verbatim and non-verbatim dates or if it is unknown whether the field corresponds to the verbatim date, it should _not_ be considered a _verbatimEventDate_.

== Structured date ==

As the verbatim date doesn't readily allows calculation and sorting, most collections (also) record the collection date in a structured format. 

Collections very often record the collection date in a structured format, even though it might not be available as such on the specimen label. The advantage is that it allows 

As the verbatim date doesn't readily allow calculation and sorting, collections very often also record a structured date
