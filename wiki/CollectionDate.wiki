= Introduction =

The collection date is the date, date range or dates on which a specimen was collected, and is typically written on the specimen label. It can be written in various date formats and is recorded in collection databases in numerous ways.

== Single date field ==

||  || *Verbatim* || *Structured* || *Structured ISO 8601:2004(E)* ||
|| Date || 8 till 15 VII 1980 || 1980 Jul 8-15 || 1980-07-08/15 ||

== Start / end date fields ==

||  || *Structured* || *Structured ISO 8601:2004(E)* ||
|| Start date || 1980 Jul 8 || 1980-07-08 ||
|| End date || 1980 Jul 15 || 1980-07-15 ||

= Recommendations =

== Verbatim date ==

The verbatim date is the collection date as written on the specimen label (see the definition for [http://code.google.com/p/applecore/wiki/Glossary#Verbatim verbatim]) and is recorded in a single free-text field. If a date field contains verbatim and non-verbatim dates or it is unknown whether the field corresponds to a verbatim date, it should not be considered a verbatim date.

Remarks or notes regarding the collection date are accepted in this field as long as the original value is included: "3/5/2009 (probably March)" or if the date is illegible: "illisible". 

Provide the verbatim date in *_verbatimEventDate_*.
