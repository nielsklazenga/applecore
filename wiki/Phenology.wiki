|| *Terms* || *Definition* ||
|| vegetative || Stage of growth when vegetative structures are being produced. No reproductive structures present.  Can refer to sporophyte and gametophyte together or can be appended with "-sporophyte" or "-gametophyte".  For example, a fern without sori present would be termed "vegetative-sporophyte".||
|| reproductive || Stage of growth when reproductive structures are present.  When referring to sporangiate plants, permissible append with "-sporophyte".  When referring to plants with antheridia and/or archegonia, permissible append with "-gametophyte".  For example, a fern with sori present would be termed "reproductive-sporophyte". ||

= Gymnosperms/Conifers: =
|| *Terms* || *Definition* ||
|| vegetative || Stage of growth when vegetative structures are being produced. No reproductive structures present. ||
|| microsporangiate || Stage of growth when pollen cones are present. ||
|| megasporangiate ||  Stage of growth when ovulate cones are present. To indicate cones of different ages, permissible to append with "-first year", "-second year", etc.||
