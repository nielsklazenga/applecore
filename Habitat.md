# Recommendations #

The habitat is the ecological or environmental area in which the specimen was collected and may be explicitly provided on the label.

If habitat is provided on the label, report this value. Habitat can be derived from the locality.

If habitat information is standardized in any form it is recommended to report habitat according to a published source and write that interpretation in square brackets.

  * verbatimLocality and habitat can overlap
  * preferred to use verbatim values, but controlled vocabulary can be used.

## Remarks ##

<font color='red'><code>[</code>DELETE? - remarks below probably not necessary, as folks could/may be placing (correctly?) habitat info into more than one DwC field<code>]</code> pws, jm</font>

If you do not have separate habitat field, put everything in occurrenceRemarks = remarks or notes about the specimen

  * occurrenceRemarks: specimen notes [remarks](specimen.md) square brackets. Also garbage field.
  * eventRemarks: it was a rainy day (very often in occurrenceRemarks)
  * locationRemarks: very often in occurrenceRemarks
